                    <h1>Latest Project: Titanium L-PBF Balloon Giveaway</h1>
                    <p>Each year, the additive manufacturing team and Jabil Albuquerque has produced a few "fun" builds as giveaways for the site staff around the end of the year. In 2021, we produced a few hundred Star Wars Death Star keychains, and in 2022, we built some lattice 
                        orb ornaments. Both of these giveaways were taken from free online files, and they required a significant amount of post-processing with rotary tools and a substantial amount of grit blasting to remove the support structures. For 2023, I decided to design
                        a giveaway that was a little more relevant to our site and that would take less hand work to clean up
                    </p>
                    <h2>Design</h2>			
                    <p>Since Albuquerue is home to the largest annual International Balloon Fiesta, I chose to make a roughly 3" tall balloon ornament. Using Solidworks, I created a sweep for the balloon profile and patterned it in a circle. I then created a solid profile to add
                         thickness to the walls of the balloon (1.5 mm). The basket at the base was created from a simple loft, and I used another loft to merge the basket to the balloon itself. I made square cuts with fillets to give the appearance of gaps between the basket and balloon.
                         This allowed the balloon to be printed without additional supports or risk of warping. At the top, I created a small feature for a ribbon or hook which also doubled as a drain hole for the unsintered powder. The first iteration of the balloon had a horizontal bar
                         which failed to print without support. The second iteration had a small arch to allow it to be self-supporting. I also added the embossed "Albuquerque" text on the side of the balloon to make the model a bit less plain.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Print Setup and Post-Processing</h2>
                    <p>In order to make sure that the text printed successfully, I had to tilt the balloon slightly (5 degrees) about the X axis so that the text faced slightly upwards. The only supports present in the entire build are the perforated supports at the base of the basket.
                        This ensured that the model was easy to remove from the build plate and that there was minimal post-processing needed to clean up the parts. I increased the laser scan speed about 20% from the defaults and used 60 Âµm to minimize build time since around 600 parts
                        were needed for everyone at the site to receive a copy.</p>

                        <div class = "col-lg-2"></div>
                        <figure class = "col-md-12 col-lg-8">

                        <div class = "col-lg-2"></div>
                    </div>
                    <p>In the end, I was able to fit 32 parts per build, and each build took approximately 21 hours. Unpacking and post-processing were extremely simple - the balloons were able to be tilted to the side to break them away from the supports, and the powder was able
                        to flow out once the parts were inverted. Each part needed about 15 seconds with a flat hand file to remove the burrs left by the supports, and they were then tumbled and blasted with grit for about 5-10 minutes per batch. Using 2 printers, we were able to produce enough parts for the site across roughly 20 builds.
