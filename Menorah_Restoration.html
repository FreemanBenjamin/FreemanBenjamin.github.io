		<h1>Menorah Restoration</h1>
		<p>One of the more unique projects that we were approached with in my time at 3D Print Texas was the replacement of a missing menorah figurine. The menorah in question was a handmade, pure silver sculpture housed at the MOllie and Louis Kaplan Museum of Judaica
			at Congregation Beth Yeshurun in Houston. The menorah stands at almost 2 feet tall and was made in Russia in 1827. At some point in the menorah's travels, one of the 8 hinged lion figures that served as the oil lamps had gone missing. The museum curator reached
			out to us to see if we would be able to replicate the missing lion from one of the remaining 7.

		<p>With the help of a local jeweler and 3D scanning, we felt confident that we could make a faithful recreation of the lion. We took the original copy to another local business to have the part scanned into a 3D file. Once we had the 3D file, I began prototyping
			 the parts on our polyjet printer to see how the scans had turned out. It quickly became clear that many of the fine details had become lost in the scan due to the reflection of the metal. I digitally sculpted the missing features in Blender to make them more 
			 prominent, particularly the ribs and hair lines for the lion's mane. After several iterations, I was able to get a suitable result for lost-wax casting. The file was sent over to the jeweler, and they proceeded to print the model in wax and cast the model in silver.
			  An artificial patina was added to the lion to make sure that it looked as similar as possible to the original copies. The final result can be seen below with the original reference lion for comparison.

		<p>In the end, it was virtually impossible to tell which lion had been recreated. The curator shared images of the newly reassembled menorah, and we were unable to tell which one was ours!</p>
