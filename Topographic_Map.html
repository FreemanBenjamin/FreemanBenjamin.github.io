				<h1>Topographic Map</h1>
				<p>While working at 3D Print Texas, I had a client reach out to ask if it was possible to print a topographic map of land that he owns in Central Texas. While I knew that this would be possible based on previous models I had seen, this was my first time going through the process of creating a full-color 3D model for printing. The USGS map below contains the area of interest.</p>
				<div class = "row">
					<div class = "col"></div>
					<figure class = "col-md-12 col-lg-6">
						<img src = "images/Waring.png"/>
						<figcaption>USGS Topograhic Map of Area</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<div class = "col"></div>
				</div>
				<p></p>				
				<p>In order to generate a 3D model, I first needed to download a suitable heightmap of the area. I chose the USGS National Elevation Dataset, 10m resolution and downloaded a bitmap/grayscale image of the area.</p>
				<div class = "row">
					<div class = "col"></div>
					<figure class = "col-md-12 col-lg-6">
						<img src = "images/Waring_Height_Map.png"/>
							<figcaption>Grayscale Elevation Data</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<div class = "col"></div>
				</div>
				<p>I then increased the contrast level slightly in photoshop to make the elevation changes more dramatic. I imported this photo into Blender and merged it onto a 8" x 8" plane. Using Blender's displacement modifier, I was able to easily generate a 3D surface of the terrain. I tweaked the strength of the displacement to make the elevation changes more obvious. </p>

					<div class = "col"></div>
					<figure class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
						<img src = "images/waring_surface.png"/>
							<figcaption>Displaced Surface Body</figcaption>
						</figure>						
					<div class = "col"></div>
				</div>
				<p>After applying the displacement modifier, I then needed to give the surface body thickness. I extruded the surface down roughly 1cm and flattened the base of the model.</p>
				<div class = "row">
					<div class = "col"></div>
					<figure class = "col-md-12 col-lg-12">
						<img src = "images/Extruded_Waring.jpg"/>
							<figcaption>Terrain After Extrusion</figcaption>
						</figure>						
					<div class = "col"></div>
				</div>
				<p>To reduce the cost of printing, I then hollowed out the interior of the model and removed the back face leaving a 1.5mm thick shell. This provided sufficient strength to prevent the model from being fragile while also substantially lowering the cost for the client.</p>

					<figure class = "col-md-12 col-lg-6">
						<img src = "images/waring_hollow.jpg"/>
							<figcaption>Back Side of Model Showing Hollowing Operation</figcaption>
						</figure>						
					<div class = "col"></div>
				</div>
				<p>Finally, I needed to apply the topographic map image to the surface of the part. In order to do this, I first lined up the map image with the bitmap image in Photoshop and cropped them to be the same size. I also increased the color contrast to make sure that the colors would be deep enough after printing. This image was then applied to the top face of the model as a texture using Blender, and the file was exported as a .obj and .mtl file for printing. The files were imported into GrabCAD Print and printed using Vero-Vivid colors on our J750 PolyJet printer.</p>

				<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
				<p>This was a somewhat challenging project that really took full advantage of the full-color capabilities and high level of detail offered by PolyJet Printing. This was the most involved project I have attempted involving textures, and it was the first time that I had used Blender to create a 3D model. I initially had tried using Photoshop's 3D tools to generate a textured 3D model, but I felt that it was too limited to accomplish what I needed. Now that I know the process, I could likely generate similar topographic models in less than an hour. The client really liked the final product, and now they have a high quality piece for their home or office.</p>
