				<h1>Small Projects</h1>
					<p> This is a collection of small 3D printing projects that are mostly just for fun or to see what my printer is capable of!</p>
				<h2>Caffeine Coaster</h2>
					<p>I drink a lot of coffee, so I almost always have a mug at my desk. However, the wood coasters that I have are slightly too small for the diameter of the mug base. Though I could have kept this project more simple by just extruding a base and raised rim to avoid sliding, I decided to test my printer's ability to print small details. Using an image I found online, I traced the outline of a caffeine molecule's skeletal formula in Autodesk Inventor. I then engraved the sketch into the surface of my extrusion. I also gave the coaster a rounded fillet on the outside edge to improve the appearance. As can be seen in the first image below, I used a hexagonal infill since it seemed appropriate for the chemical structure I was making. The engraved lettering turned out well overall, but I would definitely increase the perimeter overlap to avoid gaps between the perimeter layers surrounding the lettering.</p>

				<h2>Battery Dispenser</h2>
					<p>After seeing a multitude of battery dispensers on thingiverse, I decided to take the things I liked about the designs and make one myself. Essentially, the design I settled on has a AA battery-shaped slot at the top to drop batteries in at which point they traverse a series of ramps to the bottom. At the bottom, they are stopped by a curved bumper which makes the battery accessible. There are a few holes on the side to allow for access to clear any batteries that stick and to save material. The dispenser was printed in two pieces - the main casing, and one wall that fits inside of the main body.</p>
