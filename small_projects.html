				<h1>Small Projects</h1>
					<p> This is a collection of small 3D printing projects that are mostly just for fun or to replace broken parts.</p>
				<h2>Phone Case</h2>
					<p>This project actually took me a few more iterations than I expected (I think the final tally was 5) due to the "infinity" screen and port/camera locations. I started by making a mockup of the actual phone in SOLIDWORKS to use as a reference for the case. I then used boolean operations and trimmed away material from a body that was 1mm thicker in all directions than the phone itself. The final product was printed in PA12 nylon with a Multi Jet Fusion printer. It has lasted for over 6 months with no signes of damage or wear.</p>

				<h2>Travel Mug Button Replacement</h2>
					<p>When the injection molded button that keeps my travel mug closed failed, I had to print a new button, or the mug would be useless. I took measurements from the button by hand and added extra material at the point of failure. The replacement was printed in PA12 nylon, and it has actually already outlasted the original part!</p>

				<h2>Vacuum Motor Centralizer</h2>
					<p>The motor centralizer on my vacuum failed causing the motor to grind into the housing and wear through the roller belt. I was able to replace the original ABS injection molded component with a PA12 nylon part (again) after taking hand measurements with calipers and adding material to the weak points from the original component.</p>

				<h2>Battery Dispenser</h2>
					<p>After seeing a multitude of battery dispensers on thingiverse, I decided to take the things I liked about the designs and make one myself. Essentially, the design I settled on has a AA battery-shaped slot at the top to drop batteries in at which point they traverse a series of ramps to the bottom. At the bottom, they are stopped by a curved bumper which makes the battery accessible. There are a few holes on the side to allow for access to clear any batteries that stick and to save material. The dispenser was printed in two pieces - the main casing, and one wall that fits inside of the main body.</p>

				<h2>Caffeine Coaster</h2>
					<p>I drink a lot of coffee, so I almost always have a mug at my desk. However, the wood coasters that I have are slightly too small for the diameter of the mug base. Though I could have kept this project more simple by just extruding a base and raised rim to avoid sliding, I decided to test my printer's ability to print small details. Using an image I found online, I traced the outline of a caffeine molecule's skeletal formula in Autodesk Inventor. I then engraved the sketch into the surface of my extrusion. I also gave the coaster a rounded fillet on the outside edge to improve the appearance. As can be seen in the first image below, I used a hexagonal infill since it seemed appropriate for the chemical structure I was making. The engraved lettering turned out well overall, but I would definitely increase the perimeter overlap to avoid gaps between the perimeter layers surrounding the lettering.</p>
