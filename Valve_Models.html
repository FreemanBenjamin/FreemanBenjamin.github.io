            <h1>Valve Tradeshow Models</h1>
            <p>Since 3D Print Texas was located in the Houston area, we received many requests to build scale models of pumps, turbines, and valves for training and tradeshows. The last major tradeshow model
                 that we produced was a Celeros CUP-BB5 Pump. The model was comprised of nearly 500 components and was produced using a mixuture of filament (large components), binder-jetting (smaller components), and 
                 polyjet (flexible gaskets, small parts in color). All components of the model were given the appropriate clearance to allow for sanding, priming, painting, and clear-coating. The removable sections were
                  made with either nuts/bolts (real hardware) or hidden magnets for easy assembly/disassembly. I was responsible for preparing the CAD files for printing, setting up all of the builds, and creating the BOM
                   to the production team so that they could assemble the final model and paint each component the right color.
            </p>

            <p>We also worked on a project for Phillips 66 to provide valve and pump training models. The photos shown below were similarly modified to allow for clearance between the parts and were able to be 
                manually actuated. The threaded rod and handwheel for the globe and gate valve models were created by me and printed using Multi-Jet Fusion (threaded rod) and FDM (handwheel). The remaining parts
                 are a mixture of FDM and MJF printing with metal hardware for the connections. The transparent section on the pump model was printed in SLA and then clear-coated to improve transparency for the 
                 coupler section.
