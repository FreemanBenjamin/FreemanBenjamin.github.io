					<p>My current 3D printer is the <a href = "http://www.creality3d.cn/page92?product_id=16" target = "_blank">CR-10s by Creality</a> (pictured above) which I purchased in November 2017. It has a 300 x 300 x 400mm (12 x 12 x 14in) build platform with a heated bed. It prints via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and has the capablility to print in layer heights of roughtly 0.04mm to 0.4mm. I am currently printing using <a href = "https://hatchbox3d.com/" target = _"blank">Hatchbox</a> 1.75mm diameter filament and preparing files using <a href ="https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software" target = "_blank">Cura</a>. My modifications can be found <a href = "printer_mods">here</a></p>
				<h2>Calibration Prints</h2>
					<p>Below are two of the standard calibration prints to show the quality that the CR-10S is capable of. The first print I used to get the printer dialed in is a simple <a href = "https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1278865" target = "_blank">calibration cube</a>. For the first iteration, I used only the default print settings in Slic3r. As can be seen below, the print had several issues. First, there were substantial gaps between the layers as well as misaligned layers. To correct this, I made sure to tighten the x and y belts, checked the tightness of every screw, and ensured that the roller guides were snug against each guide rail. Additionally, the top of the cube was not properly filled in, and the perimeter layers did not properly overlap. Finally, areas of bridged material were poorly formed which caused the lettering to be imprecise. To remedy these two problems, I increased perimeter overlap from 55% to 65% and slowed the perimeter speed from 60mm/s to 40mm/s. As can be seen in the images below, the second cube exhibited good layer alignment and overlap, had improved perimeter and infill bonding, and showed less oozing in bridge areas.</p>

					<p>As a second demonstration of the capabilities of this printer, I made <a href = "https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622" target = "_blank">"benchy"</a> which is a common "torture-test" for 3D printers. This model offers a combination of difficult features such as overhangs, bridges, curved surfaces, fine lettering, and other fine details. Overall, as can be seen in the images below, the CR-10S handled most of these features well. The primary methods of failure were:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stringing - This could be due to filament retraction or extruding at too high of a temperature. This was easily cleaned by just pulling the loose plastic away.</li>
						<li>Rear Text - The text on the back of the model was not legible. I think this could be improved with a slightly slower speed and smaller layer height.</li>
						<li>Oozing/Scarring - A few areas showed signs of oozing. Lowering the extrusion multiplier or increasing retraction would probably eliminate this.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Overall, I was quite pleased with the quality of the final print. The layer heights were consistent, overhangs and bridges were clean, and most of the finer details printed without issue.</p>
