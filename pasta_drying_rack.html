				<h1>Pasta Drying Rack</h1>
				<p>This was a small project to make a drying rack for pasta as a gift. After seeing what was available online, I decided that it would be relatively simple and more interesting to make one myself. The basic design is a central dowel with smaller dowels running perpendicularly through it and spaced at 45 degree angles to each other to keep the pasta from touching while hanging. The central dowel is then inserted into a heavy base to keep the rack from falling over when pasta is placed on the dowels. The entire setup is made from red oak - the dowels were readily available from the hardware store, but I had to go to a lumber supplier to find an appropriately sized piece for the base. Luckily, the lumber yard I went to had inexpensive and high-quality scrap pieces of red oak available.</p>

				<p>The most difficult part of the actual construction was drilling the holes into the rounded dowel. Without any kind of stabilizer or guide, it would be challenging to drill straight holes into the surface of the dowel. To avoid this, I created a guide using a spare piece of 2x4.
				Using a hole saw kit for power drills, I first bored a 5/8" hole for the central dowel to fit through. Then, I drilled a 1/4" hole perpendicular to the first to make the holes for the small dowels.</p>

				</div>
				<p>Using this guide, I then drilled 4 holes spaced 1/2" apart vertically. These were oriented in two 0/90 configurations rotated 45 degrees from each other to avoid having too little room to hang the pasta.</p>

				<p>After drilling the central dowel, the horizontal dowels were cut to size, and I again used the hole saw attachments to make a hole in the base piece. I affixed rubber grips to the corners of the base to prevent slipping, and the entire assembly was oiled using cutting board oil to protect the wood and prevent sticking. The entire rack is easy to take apart, reassemble, and store to ensure maximum ease of use.</p>
